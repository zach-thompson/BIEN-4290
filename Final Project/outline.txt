Steps:
Boundary extension
Low-pass filtering
DFT
Convolution with filter
Inverse DFT
Windowing
Regional max (we have to write*)
Dilation *
Centroid *

// For the low pass filter, run first with relaxed restrictions - then average nearest distance to each local max and use that value as the cutoff for the second filtering

Other notes
CLMG library / OpenCV library also an option
Convert MATLAB functions to C++
Create a point class to hold coordinates
